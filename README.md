# Ciao 👋
## I' m Tommaso
another guy trying to change career into web development after a degree in philosophy, years of hospitality and a few as brewer. If I don't change things I get bored 🥱

### 👷 I’m currently working on
learning front end development, starting from the basics: html, css and js. I recently started a bootcamp at Founders and Coders that will hopefully take me to the next level! 

### 📚 I’m currently learning
about the exciting world of asynchronous task management and exploring the art of sending HTTP requests with JavaScript

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on 
anything really, I've spent enough time trying to learn and code by myself. I'm ready to share the struggle and the thrill of the whole process with others

### 🫱‍🫲 I’m looking for help with 
everything really!
